## KEEP Kotlin Scripting support

From

https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2018/06/kotlin-1-2-50-is-out/

* it is now possible to create a jar defining a script and if that jar is added to the compilation classpath, the scripts of this type will be automatically supported by the compiler and IDEA plugin
* it is now possible to pass typed external variables to the script compilation, so they will be accessible as if they are global variables defined outside of the script
* the structure of the scripting support is now much simpler and provided helpers allow to implement and embed a custom scripting host much easier than before

## dependency declarations

kotlin [jupyter kernel ](https://github.com/ligee/kotlin-jupyter/blob/6ec1e5f8e4fc0a8ce0015194518275201fd5f3eb/readme.md)supports

* `@file:DependsOnJar(<relative|absolute-path-in-dir-repo>)` - adds a class directory or jar to the classpath
* `@file:DirRepository(<absolute-path>)` - adds a directory as a repo
* `@file:DependsOnMaven(<colon-separated-maven-coordinates>)` - resolves artifacts using maven, downloads them if necessary, and adds to the classpath
* `@file:MavenRepository(<mavenRepoUrl>)` - adds a maven repository

which seem to come from https://github.com/kohesive/keplin//keplin-maven-resolver/src/main/kotlin/uy/kohesive/keplin/kotlin/script/resolver/maven/MavenResolverAnnotations.kt


They also have impl a programmatic mvn resolver there https://github.com/kohesive/keplin/blob/master/keplin-maven-resolver/src/main/kotlin/uy/kohesive/keplin/kotlin/script/resolver/maven/MavenScriptDependenciesResolver.kt

Could be used as a library, see

```
apply plugin: 'java'

dependencies {

  runtime group: 'org.apache.zookeeper',  name: 'zookeeper', version: '3.4.6'

Download the dependencies (and their dependencies) into the folder runtime when you execute `./gradlew getDeps`.

Kotlin natively supports scripting to a limited extent, so it is valid to use #! (shebang) directives at the top of kotlin source files.

## kotlinc shebang config

http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/20880/how-can-i-use-environment-variables-in-my-shebang

Shebang lines do not undergo variable expansion, so you cannot use $FOO/MyCustomPython as it would search for an executable named dollar-F-O-O-...

## Why not use env?
http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/#interpreter-script

Most probably there isn't any Bell-Labs- or Berkeley-derived Unix that accepts the interpreter to be a script, which starts with #! again.
However, Linux since 2.6.27.9 2 and Minix accept this.

Also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)#Portability

 Some systems, including Linux, do not split up the arguments;[10] for example, when running the script with the first line like,

## how does process substitution work?

http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/156084/why-does-process-substitution-result-in-a-file-called-dev-fd-63-which-is-a-pipe

When you do `<(some_command)`, your shell executes the command inside the parentheses and replaces the whole thing with a file descriptor, that is connected to the command's stdout. So `/dev/fd/63` is a pipe containing the output of your ls call.

Suprocess management

buffer handling is limited with standard jdk ProcessBuilder because buffer is limit and will block once full.
